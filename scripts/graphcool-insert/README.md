# Objective

Graphcool's import system doesn't work, so rolling my own GraphQL-based solution. Goal is to have a standardized
JSON format that enables me to perform a series of mutations that effectively does an insert.

# Usage

Uncomment `run()` on last line of `run.js`, make sure the inputs and `run` function are doing what you expect.

Then `yarn run insert`
